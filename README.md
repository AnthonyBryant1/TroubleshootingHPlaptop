<h1>Troubleshooting an HP Laptop with No Password and Poor Performance</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved assisting a friend with recovering access to their HP laptop after they forgot their password, as well as addressing the device's poor performance. Prior to the password issue, the laptop had struggled with basic tasks like web browsing, likely due to system configuration or resource limitations. The project included steps for a secure login bypass, performance diagnostics, and optimization to improve usability.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>The Password Issue</h3>
<p>In a previous project, I helped a roommate regain access to a Windows XP device by using the sticky keys method to bypass a forgotten password. With that experience in mind, I was prepared to explore a similar approach here. However, when troubleshooting, it’s always best to start with simple, quick solutions. I noticed a four-digit string at the end of my friend’s username, which led me to try switching the login method to a PIN. This straightforward approach worked seamlessly—no password reset necessary.</p>

<h3>The First Snag</h3>
<p>Next, I began evaluating the laptop’s performance. Before diving into metrics, I identified a critical issue: the battery was dead. The device could only power on when plugged in but wasn’t receiving a charge, which raised potential concerns.</p>

<p>From previous experience, I knew that running certain laptops solely on plug power can degrade performance and even risk hard drive damage, as some models are not configured to operate effectively without a functioning battery. The first step, therefore, was to discuss with my friend the option of purchasing a third-party replacement battery for $30, as the manufacturer no longer offered a compatible replacement.</p>

<p>I also made sure to disclose that, given the device’s age and limited specs, it might not deliver much value or performance, even if functional, and that there was no guarantee our efforts would resolve all issues. He consented to proceed with purchasing the new part. </p>
